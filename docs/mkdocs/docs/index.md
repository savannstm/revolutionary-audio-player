## About RAP

Revolutionary Audio Player, abbreviated RAP, is an audio player designed with simplicity and maximum featurefulness in mind.

This documentation covers all its features, and how to use ALL of them.

## Quick Overview

When you first open RAP, you'll see no popups, no setting confirmation windows, no nothing.

From the moment you open the player - it's already ready to use. Plug & Play, simple as-is.

Things you need to know at that point:

1. There's a _dock bar in the right side of the main window_, which can be expanded or collapsed. It will automatically load track metadata and track cover, you can reposition it, or remove metadata/cover from it.
2. Application settings are located in `File > Settings`. By default, the player is configured to leave _no trace in the OS_. You can toggle system file associations or whatever there.
3. You can start playing tracks _right away_, by drag'n'dropping something into the application window or opening through `File` menu.
4. RAP features _playlist-based playback system_. Any track that you want to play has to be added to a playlist; new playlist will be created automatically if there's no such.
5. RAP supports all _modern audio file formats and playlist formats_ such as `m3u`, `xspf` and `cue`. RAP does NOT support all possible audio formats and will NEVER pursue such goal.
6. RAP always minimizes itself into the _tray icon_ and should be closed from there.
7. RAP _doesn't operate with plugins or modules_. To have access to some feature, you don't need to enable anything. Everything is _opt-in by default for convenience_. Why do you have to enable, let's say, _tray icon in some players manually_?

_By the way, check this out - we placed the sliders right into the tray icon menu! (CURRENTLY WINDOWS ONLY)_
